# 🧠 Supply Chain SQL + Power BI Project

This project simulates a multi-warehouse retail supply chain system. I used SQL to analyze product performance, inventory turnover, and sales trends, then visualized the results in Power BI.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- SQLite for SQL querying
- Power BI for dashboard visualization
- Excel / CSV for data simulation

## 📂 Data Tables
- `products`: product catalog
- `warehouses`: regional distribution centers
- `inventory`: inventory per product/warehouse
- `sales`: sales transactions
- `suppliers`: vendor info
- `reorders`: stock replenishment logs

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries
- Top-selling products by category
- Monthly sales trends
- Inventory turnover rate
- Low inventory alerts
- Profitability analysis

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Import the `.csv` files into SQLite or another SQL platform.
2. Run the SQL queries from the `/sql` folder.
3. Connect Power BI to visualize the results.
